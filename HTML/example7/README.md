## html tags 

    Responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices!

    A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    This will set the viewport of your page, which will give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

    Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag:

    The <kbd> element defines keyboard input
    The <samp> element defines sample output from a computer program
    The <code> element defines a piece of computer code
    The <var> element defines a variable in programming or in a mathematical expression
    The <pre> element defines preformatted text
    <article>	Defines independent, self-contained content
    <aside>	Defines content aside from the page content
    <details>	Defines additional details that the user can view or hide
    <figcaption>	Defines a caption for a <figure> element
    <figure>	Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams,     photos, code listings, etc.
    <footer>	Defines a footer for a document or section
    <header>	Specifies a header for a document or section
    <main>	Specifies the main content of a document
    <mark>	Defines marked/highlighted text
    <nav>	Defines navigation links
    <section>	Defines a section in a document
    <summary>	Defines a visible heading for a <details> element
    <time>	Defines a date/time
