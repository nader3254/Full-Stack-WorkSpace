## Using CSS

    CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

    Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
    Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
    External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
    The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.    However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this     is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.
